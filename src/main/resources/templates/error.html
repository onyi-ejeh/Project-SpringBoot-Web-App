<!--
    Error Page Template
    -------------------
    This Thymeleaf template renders an error page to indicate that the user does not have
    the necessary permissions to access a particular resource.

    Structure:
    - The document sets the page title to "Error Page", which is displayed in the browser tab.
    - The main heading ("You have no access!") informs the user that access is denied.
    - A paragraph provides additional context about the access restriction.
    - Two navigation links are provided:
        - A "Home" link to navigate back to the homepage.
        - A "Logout" link to log out of the current session.

    Usage:
    - This template should be rendered when a user attempts to access a restricted page.
    - It can be used in combination with security configurations to handle access denied errors.
